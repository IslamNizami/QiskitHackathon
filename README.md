# 🔐 Quantum Key Distribution – BB84 with Toeplitz Privacy Amplification

This project implements the **BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol** using Qiskit, enhanced with **Toeplitz universal hashing** for real-world privacy amplification.

> Goal: Secure key exchange resistant to quantum attacks  
> Method: Physics-based security — eavesdropping changes quantum states
